# Lucky Me

## Overview
Lucky Me is a blockchain-based prediction game where players stake CORE, submit answers to randomly generated questions, and earn points for correct predictions. Players are ranked on a leaderboard based on their total points. The game is powered by a **React + TypeScript frontend** integrated with a **Solidity smart contract** deployed on the blockchain.

## Tech Stack
### Frontend
- **React.js** â€“ User interface
- **TypeScript** â€“ Type safety and development efficiency
- **RainbowKit** â€“ Wallet connection and Web3 interactions
- **Ethers.js** â€“ Smart contract interaction
- **Tailwind CSS** â€“ Styling

### Smart Contract
- **Solidity** â€“ Smart contract logic
- **Hardhat** â€“ Smart contract development and testing
- **Core DAO Blockchain** â€“ Deployed network

## Features
- **Wallet Connection**: Users connect via RainbowKit.
- **CORE Staking**: Players stake CORE before playing.
- **AI-Powered Answer Generation**: The game utilizes an AI agent to generate random answers for each prediction question.
- **Blockchain-Based Randomness**: AI-generated answers are verified using on-chain randomness, ensuring fairness and unpredictability.
- **Prediction System**: Players submit answers to game questions.
- **Automated Scoring**: Points awarded based on correct answers.
- **Streak Bonus**: Extra points for consecutive correct answers.
- **Leaderboard**: Top players ranked by total points.
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Data stored securely on-chain.

## How It Works
1. **Stake CORE Tokens**: Players must stake **0.02 CORE** before starting a game.
2. **Receive 10 Questions**: The game presents 10 randomly generated prediction-based questions.
3. **AI Randomly Selects Answers**: A blockchain-based AI agent determines correct answers using **Chainlink VRF** for fairness.
4. **Answer Submission**: Players select either option **A or B** as their prediction.
5. **Leaderboard & Rewards**: Players are ranked by their scores. If a player gets **8 or more correct answers**, they double their stake.
